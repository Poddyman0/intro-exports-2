# Mastering Exports and Requires in Node.js

**Description:**

I focused on learning how to manage code across multiple files in Node.js by practicing the use of exports and requires. This included understanding how to organize code into separate modules and link them together effectively. The exercises involved working with a GitHub repository to practice exporting and requiring modules.

**Technologies Used:**

- **Node.js:** For managing modules and practicing file imports and exports.
- **Git:** For version control and handling repository operations.

**Features Implemented:**

- **Module Concept:**
  - Understood that each file in Node.js is treated as a separate module.
  - Learned that `module` represents the current module being executed.

- **Using require Function:**
  - Practiced using the `require` function to include modules from other files.
  - Experimented with including different types of modules (e.g., functions, objects, classes).

- **Using module.exports:**
  - Implemented `module.exports` to define what is returned when a module is required elsewhere.
  - Explored various ways to export values, including functions, objects, and variables.

- **Repository Practice:**
  - Forked and cloned a GitHub repository to work through exercises on exporting and requiring modules.
  - Managed and tracked changes in the codebase using Git.
